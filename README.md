# k8sJsontoUvl

![Overview of the conversion process](resources/k8sJsontoUvl_overview.PNG)

## Description

**k8sJsontoUvl** is an automated pipeline for extracting a variability model from Kubernetes’ OpenAPI JSON schemas. It produces a [UVL (Universal Variability Language)](https://universal-variability-language.github.io/) feature model representing configuration options and their constraints.

The pipeline includes:
- Schema parsing and property mapping
- Rule-based constraint generation
- UVL model synthesis
- YAML-to-feature mapping and configuration validation using [Flamapy](https://www.flamapy.org/)

It is designed for research, analysis, and validation scenarios where formal modeling of complex system configurations (like Kubernetes) is required.

---

## How to use it

The usage involves two main steps:
1. Obtain a version of the Kubernetes `_definitions.json` schema (e.g., using the `scriptGetRepoVersion.sh`)
2. Run the main conversion script to generate the `.uvl` feature model

YAML configurations can then be mapped and validated against the model.

## Using the scripts

### Requirements

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flamapy](https://www.flamapy.org/)
- Git
- Bash or PowerShell for script execution

---

### Download and install

1. Install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)

2. Clone this repository and enter the project folder:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-user/fm-json-kubernetes
  cd fm-json-kubernetes
  ```
3. Create a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  python -m venv env
  ```

4. Activate the environment:

  - **Linux:**
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
  - **Windows:**
    ```powershell
    .\env\Scripts\Activate
    ```

5. Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Execution


To obtain the Kubernetes JSON schema, use the included script:

```bash
./scripts/scriptGetRepoVersion.sh
```

> ⚙️ Modify the version by changing the line:
> ```bash
> echo "v1.30.2" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
> ```

Or dowload manually from https://github.com/yannh/kubernetes-json-schema

Then run the main feature model generator:

```bash
python scripts/convert01.py
```

Make sure to update the path to the `_definitions.json` file at the bottom of the script:

```python
definitions_file = './resources/kubernetes-json-v1.30.2/_definitions.json'
```

#### Output files:


- `kubernetes_combined_04.uvl`: Final synthesized feature model.
- `descriptions_01.json`: Grouped and parsed feature descriptions used for constraint generation.

### Pipeline stages

- `convert01.py`: Parses JSON schemas and builds the UVL model.
- `mappingUVL.csv`: Maps YAML keys to UVL features.
- `mappingYAMLJSON.py`: Converts YAML files into JSON candidates for validation.
- `getStatisticsValid.py`: Run validation, configuration and generate result summaries.

### Key folders

- `/scripts/`: Scripts and main utilities.
- `/evaluation/`: Results data of evaluations.
- `/variability_model/`: Feature models results and diagrams.
- `/resources/`: Example Kubernetes schema inputs.
